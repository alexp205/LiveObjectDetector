# LiveObjectDetector
Small neural network image classifier project that predicts based on live image feed data.

## Data Information
The data consists of ~450 images each of tennis balls, mangos, and lemons.

## Neural Network Structure
The general structure of the network follows that of a convolutional neural network with 2 convolutional and 2 resize layers.

NOTE: this project is (probably) permanently on hold b/c it's already been done through other endeavors of mine and b/c debugging tf, cuda, and cudnn crap is by far the most painful thing I've ever suffered through in the history of my existence :)
